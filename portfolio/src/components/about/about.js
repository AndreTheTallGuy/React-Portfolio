        <p>
          As a lifelong learner, I have consistently pushed myself to explore
          and discover new things. This drive has taken me to some amazing
          places such as working at an elephant sanctuary in Thailand, teaching
          English in France and Chile, and even working as a raptor handler.
          Most recently this drive has brought me into a coding bootcamp through
          Northwestern University. In this fast paced course I have worked to
          excel at each and every assignment to master the materials presented.
          I am quickly gaining proficiency with HTML, CSS, Javascript/Jquery,
          Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and React. I also have some prior experience
          with WordPress. In addition to learning languages and libraries, I've
          developed the skills to modify existing software, debug code, and
          adapt to new technologies. I am now enthusiastically searching for my
          first job as a developer where I can utilize all of these skills and
          learn some new ones as well.
